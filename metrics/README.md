# Metrics Optimization

Optimization exercise on an example metrics program which calculates averages and standard deviation across a mock dataset of users and their payments.

* `metrics_baseline.go` is the program as given.

* `metrics_optized.go` is an optimized version that uses an array-based vs object-oriented approach.

* `metrics_streaming.go` is a second optimized version that uses a single pass through the source files.

To run benchmarks:

```sh
